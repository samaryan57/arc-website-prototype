Interested in joining ARC? Attend one of our Fall 2022 callout events during the second week of school.

We will discuss the general organization of ARC, as well as some of our past projects.

The details for these callout events are as follows:

- Tuesday, August 30th, from 6:00-7:00pm at ARMS B061
- Thursday, September 1st, from 6:00-7:00pm at ARMS B061

As you can see, they both take place in the basement of Armstrong.

Outside of attending the callout, you should join the discord (linked [here](/join)).
