## Meet the robots

### Protoarm

This is protoarm (short for prototype arm), a 5-DOF robot arm adapted slightly from [HowToMechatronics' model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B3gWd3A_SI) that we built first to understand ROS, MoveIt, and the software stack for robot arms.

### BCN3D Moveo Arm
This is the [BCN3D Moveo](https://www.bcn3d.com/bcn3d-moveo-the-future-of-learning-robotic-arm/) arm that is fully open-source, built with steppers rather than cheap servos which have feedback control (a step up from the Protoarm), and is actually big enough to reach a full size chessboard. It also is much better designed and assembled than the Protoarm.
