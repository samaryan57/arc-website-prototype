### Pre-flight Planning

The idea was to generate a occupancy grid of campus that can be used as an occupancy grid. 
* Used OpenStreetMap to generate a isolated 3d map of campus. 
    * https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/38.007/-95.844
* Converted that into a 2D map using Rasterization techniques. 
* Initially planned on using Octrees, but later decided not to due to the vast amount of memory that would consume. 
* Has a separate page, which describes the stack in much greater detail.

The following is the point cloud generated from OpenStreetMap.

### Obstacle Avoidance:

* Migrate the code for Realsense camera from Python â†’ C++
   * Able to get depth matrix
   * Can convert to occupancy matrix
* Implimenting a the D* and A* algorithms. 
   * There are issues in how the paths are generated, in that sometimes diagonal paths are taken over straight ones, even though the latter is possible to produce. 
   * To be improved in Spring 2023. 
* OpenCV integration for detecting obstacles at a greater depth. 

The Output from the A* algorithm we develped:

An example of an unideal path:

### Hardware:
* Established mission objectives, such as flight time and pay load weight.
* Picked a drone kit, selected baterries, motor controllers, motors and propellers. 
    *  A detailed document describing all the design choices that were made:

* Check the main page for details on what hardware components were selected. 

### Interfacing:
* Repaired the old drone, and interfaced a computer with it.
* Simulated pre-programmed fight paths using Gazebo and QGroundControl. 
* Worked on importing OpenStreetMap data into Gazebo.

### Research: 
* Over the course of the semester, the team reseached several important topics and developed whitepapers, and plan documents. 
    * Deegan Osmundson: A* based navigation algorithms.
