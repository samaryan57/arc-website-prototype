## Description

We're building a groundbreaking fusion of a drone and a robotic dog, featuring autonomous navigation and camera/lidar vision. Inspired by innovations in robotic dogs (Boston Dynamics' Spot), flying cars, and drones, our goal is to create a versatile robot capable of seamless transitions, effortlessly traversing rocky land and taking flight in the air, primarily for exploration purposes. Join us as we push the boundaries of robotics to create the marvel that is DogCopter.
