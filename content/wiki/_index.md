Welcome to the Autonomous Robotics Club (ARC) Wiki!

Robotics isnâ€™t easy. The goal of this wiki is to document the progress of the various robotics projects created at ARC, so new members can contribute effectively to projects and for visitors to find inspiration and build off of our projects.

If you have feedback regarding articles in this wiki, do not hesitate to use the comment section under each article to get clarifications and share your ideas!

Happy robot building!
